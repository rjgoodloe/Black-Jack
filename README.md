# Black-Jack

This is the third project in my CSE438 Android Development class.

The app allows users to create an account to track their wins, losses, and money; 
all of which are displayed in a leaderboard ranking all users by win/loss ratio.
Users play black jack against the dealer in typical fashion. Betting, hitting, and
standing are done with gesture detection. 

Gestures:
Swipe up -> bet
Swipe right -> hit
Double tap -> stand
